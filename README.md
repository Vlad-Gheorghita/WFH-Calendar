# :calendar: WFH Calendar


This custom calendar lets you mark specific days when working from home during the current month, helping you track the remaining available days. The application is built with Angular and uses Firebase for the backend and hosting. You can access the website by clicking [here](https://wfh-calendar.web.app).
